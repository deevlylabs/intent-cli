## The problem

AI agents write code faster than any human. They also break your architecture faster than any human.

A single agent-generated PR can touch 40 files across 5 domains. It imports directly from modules it shouldn't know about. It updates database tables owned by another team. It does all of this while producing code that *works* — and that's what makes it dangerous.

By the time you notice, the damage is spread across dozens of merged PRs. Refactoring costs weeks. The architecture diagram no longer matches reality.

## The solution

**INTENT** is a lightweight DSL and CLI that enforces architectural domain boundaries on every pull request.

You declare your rules once:

```
domain Identity {
  paths allow "src/auth/**", "lib/auth/**"
}

domain Billing {
  paths allow "src/billing/**"
}
```

Every diff is evaluated automatically. Cross-domain violations are blocked before merge — with clear messages and fix suggestions.

```
▲ INTENT v2.0 • MyApp • scope: Identity (cli_override) • 4 files

  🚨 1 BLOCKING VIOLATION

  ✖ [CrossDomainTouch] src/billing/invoice.ts:28
    PR touches Billing but task is scoped to Identity: src/billing/invoice.ts
    → Split into separate PR, or tag intentional-cross-domain with approval.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  BLOCKED  1 error
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

The agent gets the feedback. It fixes the violation. You just approve.

## Get started in 60 seconds

```bash
npm install -g @intent/cli

intent init        # generates system.intent + policies/
intent plan        # evaluates your current diff
```

That's it. Edit `system.intent` to match your real architecture, and INTENT is enforcing from the first PR.

## Why INTENT

| Without INTENT | With INTENT |
|---|---|
| Architecture enforced socially (reviews, conventions) | Architecture enforced deterministically (DSL + CLI) |
| Manual review for domain boundary compliance | Automated evaluation on every PR |
| Implicit domain boundaries, undocumented | Explicit domain declarations, version-controlled |
| Drift accumulates silently across merged PRs | Violations blocked before merge |

---

## Built for AI workflows

INTENT works for any team, but it shines when AI agents are generating code. Agents optimize locally and break boundaries silently — INTENT catches it before merge.

The governance loop is automatic:

1. Agent generates code → opens PR
2. `intent plan --json` evaluates the diff
3. Blocked? → agent reads `intent.plan.json`, fixes violations, re-runs
4. Pass? → merge

No manual architectural policing required. The agent stays inside the lines.

## How it works

INTENT evaluates diffs through a deterministic pipeline:

1. **Load** `system.intent` (domains + paths) and `policies/*.intent` (rules)
2. **Diff** — extract changed files from `git diff`
3. **Map** — resolve each file to its owning domain
4. **Evaluate** — check every rule against every changed file
5. **Report** — emit `intent.plan.json` + human-readable report

No network calls. No AI in the evaluator. No hidden state. Same inputs → same output, every time.

---

## Who is this for

- **AI-heavy teams** shipping fast with Cursor, Claude, Copilot or agent swarms — who need their codebase to stay clean without slowing down.
- **Growing engineering orgs (5–50+)** where implicit conventions no longer scale and domain boundaries need to be enforced, not just documented.
- **Regulated environments** (fintech, healthtech, B2B SaaS) that need auditable, deterministic proof that architectural boundaries are respected.

## CLI at a glance

```bash
intent init                  # scaffold system.intent + policies/
intent plan --scope Billing  # evaluate diff against rules
intent fix --dry-run         # preview auto-fixes
intent plan --json           # machine-readable output for CI/agents
```

| Exit code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | Pass or warn — safe to merge |
| `1` | Blocked — violations must be fixed |
| `2` | Engine error |
